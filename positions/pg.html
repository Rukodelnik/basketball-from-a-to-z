                    The point guard (PG),[2] also known as the one, is typically the team's shortest player and best ball handler and passer. They usually are very fast and are good at driving and short-range. Therefore, they often lead their team in assists and are able to create shots for themselves and their teammates. They are quick and able to hit shots outside the key but a majority are inside the 3 point line or layups, largely depending on the player's skill level. Point guards are looked upon as the "floor general" or the "coach on the floor, and the heart of the team." They should study the game and game film to be able to recognize the weaknesses of the defense, and the strengths of their own offense. They are responsible for directing plays, making the position equivalent to that of quarterback in football, playmaker in soccer, center in ice hockey, or setter in volleyball. They are expected to have high basketball IQ and good pacing to successfully operate the offensive schemes during the game while barely turning the ball over.[3][4] Good point guards increase team efficiency and generally have a high number of assists. They are often referred to as dribblers or playmakers. In the NBA, point guards are mostly between 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) and 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m).[5][6]

                    Point guards are required to do many things in the game of basketball that are very different from the other four positions on the court. While the other 4 positions are mainly focused on putting the ball in the hoop, the point guard must have a different, more team focused mentality.[7] There are usually two types of point guards: a scoring point guard (also known as a lead guard) and a facilitator-type point guard. A scoring point guard regularly has the ability to shoot from three-point or mid-range distance. This type of point guard could also score around the basket with floaters, acrobatic layups or dunks. Damian Lillard and Stephen Curry are two examples of a scoring point guard. A facilitator-type point guard often has a high basketball IQ, or intuitive understanding of the game, and can see plays happening before they occur. In addition, these types of point guards are typically masters of the half court set offense, and they typically know the correct spots for each player on the court. Another name for this type of player could be ‘Coach on the Floor’. Chris Paul and Chelsea Gray are examples of a facilitator-type point guard.[8]
